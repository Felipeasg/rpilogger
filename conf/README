This is a directory containing almost all modified system 
configuration files compared to the Raspbian wheezy distro.
If you have downloaded the image from http://opendatalogger.com
there is no need to do anythin with these.

It is maintained for helping to port the config files to another
distro more easily. Written by Daniel Piri 2015
