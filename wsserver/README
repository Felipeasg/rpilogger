This directory includes the services 

- tailf-server for websocket connections (real-time display of log files on 
a website (like on that of the dataloggers own diagnostic page))
- reboot-server which listens on a TCP port for a "key" and 
also checks the presense of the file /home/pi/delete_to_reboot intended to 
remotely reboot the machine if sshd might hang.

These 2 are respawned from inittab! Do not modify path of name!

Furthermore, there is a script online.sh or online_ssh.sh
- which is intended to send heartbeat signal to a remote server / and create remote
ssh connection if needed. If not needed and you decide to remove, check crontabs/cronjobs 
to clean up correspondingly.
